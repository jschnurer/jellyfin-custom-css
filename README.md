# jellyfin-custom-css
A collection of some custom CSS styles I've created for Jellyfin's web UI. 

# Adding to Jellyfin
Go to the Admin Dashboard > General and there should be a Custom CSS textbox you can paste these into.

# 480x320
This custom style set shuffles some things around, shrinks them, and hides some in an attempt to make the UI work better in a 480x320 viewport. It also causes the Now Playing section to scroll while keeping the current song in view.

# now-playing-scrolls
This custom style set is for viewports of at least 689px wide and causes the Now Playing section to scroll while keeping the current song in view.
